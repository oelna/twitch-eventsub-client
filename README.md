# Twitch EventSub Client

A websocket-based client for Twitch EventSub (use as OBS browser source)

## Kind of working!

Rename `config-sample.json` to `config.json` and fill in client_id, channel name, etc.

The app will let you auth with Twitch and start receiving EventSub notifications!

Some config is possible, CSS is contained in `index.html`.
